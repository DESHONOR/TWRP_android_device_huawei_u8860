Credits go to Forumber cos i have been inspired a lot from his work...
           to Dazzozo cos his huawei device tree helped somehow for fixing charging animation and reboot to recovery.
           to TeamWinRecoveryProject
           to dees_troy for pointing me in good direction to fix latest bugs
